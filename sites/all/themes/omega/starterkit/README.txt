Omega Theme Information
=======================
The Omega Theme is a powerful and free Drupal theme based on the 960gs. 
It harneses the power and features of many popular themes to provide an 
excellent base theme, and sub-theming system to help you quickly prototype 
and theme your site...

Creating your Omega Sub Theme
=============================

1.  Copy the starterkit folder from the default Omega theme directory 
    and place it in your sites/all/themes directory.

2.  Rename the folder to the theme name of your choice.
    (subtheme for this example)
    
3.  Rename omega_starterkit.info to subtheme.info and modify default
    information in the .info file as needed (name & description)
    
4.  Open template.php and search and replace omega_starterkit with
    "subtheme" or the appropriate name of the theme you are creating.
    
5.  Open theme-settings.php and search and replace omega_starterkit with
    "subtheme" or the appropriate name of the theme you are creating.
    
6.  Visit admin/build/themes/settings/subtheme and configure to your 
    hearts desire!!
