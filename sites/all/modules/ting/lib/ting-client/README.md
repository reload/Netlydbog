Ting DBC PHP5 Client
====================

A library for accessing the [Ting][] API developed by [DBC][] using PHP5.

The client currently supports:

* Searching the API
* Content recommendation
* Spelling and autocomplete suggestions

The client has been developed for use with [Drupal][], but we have
attempted to make it as independent of Drupal as possible.

Running tests
-------------

The tests are run through the SimpleTest framework included with Drupal 7
and later versions. To run them, you'll need the Ting module.
